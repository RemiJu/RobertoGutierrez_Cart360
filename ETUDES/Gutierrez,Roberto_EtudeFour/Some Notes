I made two videos, one with the regular Piezo and the other with a larger speaker.

For some reason (likely because one of the buttons seems to be stuck on or somesuch) the speaker will sometimes keep making noise
despite no button being pressed.

During Record mode for some reason (likely due to a delay I put in) there is a stutter in the button presses.
I decided t keep it in because it sounded interesting, and ultimately doesnt affect the recording. I've always
had a bit of an interest in stuttering in music.

Additionally I provide credit to Steven Papadakos, the friend I constantly mention in the comments, for helping
out a lot with the code, in spite of not knowing much about arduino, his prior experience being with Raspberry Pi.

I also want to credit Melina Lopez-Racine for help as well, she helped me to figure out a few things I wasn't able to and 
didnt have the chance to ask Sabine or Elio for help due to many of my class and work schedules conflicting with
lab times.

Overall a fun Etude.
